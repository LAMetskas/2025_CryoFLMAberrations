# Cryo-FLM-aberrations

Thistoolbox is distributed as accompanying software for manuscript: Hongjia Li, Lauren Ann Metskas and Fang Huang, "Systematic Characterization of Optical Aberrations Reveals Cryo-FLM Localization Fidelity "

We provide three MATLAB toolboxes as supplementary software for this manuscript:
1.	MLE-based Phase Retrieval Algorithm – For retrieving point spread function (PSF) models from bead image stacks.
2.	Data Simulation for Biplane Setup – For generating simulated biplane datasets.
3.	3D Localization for Biplane Setup – For high-precision single-molecule localization in biplane microscopy.
