This describes a set of core PSF functions that we make use of ourself and also share as a toolbox. 

All codes will be object oriented using MATLAB classes. 
Follow the convention of lowercase for methods, Captital for properties:   method:   startMCMC()   property:  NCoefficients
All codes should have a simple test exmple.  
All codes should have clear documentation at top of m-file and be well-annotated throughout. 
Mex codes should have a *.m help file. 
Mex codes should be in a single VS2013 solution. 

We want stand alone codes for the following: 

Hanser Phase Retrieval Algoritm (Data Preprocessed)
PSF Generation from Pupil Image (Using FTs and Direct Integration)
PSF Generation from Zernike Coefficents (Using 1D Integration and Direct Integration)
NA Retrival from infocus point source 

Codes that make use of the above:

Vector PSF calculator
Zernike direct search method
Organizing/Pre-process class for Hanser algorithm.
